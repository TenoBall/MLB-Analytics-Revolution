Editor's Note: Adding a blog style notes to this analysis in README until I have something else set up.  
All data gathered from Baseball Reference.  

### Foreward  
This analysis was originally completed and taught in a 2023 Satisitical Consulting class at MIT. The legendary MIT statistician [Arnie Barnett](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/arnold-i-barnett) usually taught the class while I was his lowly TA. Knowing I was enamored with sports analytics and statistics, Arnie encouraged me to teach a class on the subject and the main findings of the analysis are in this repo. The lecture was more narrative-driven and less statistics.  

The analysis in this repo was updated based on the last three seasons of the MLB.
